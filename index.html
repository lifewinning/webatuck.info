	<h1>webutuck maps</h1>
	<p>In September 2013, students in Webutuck High School art classes participated in a mapping workshop where they made maps of their lives--things they did, things they liked, things they didn't like, and things they'd like to see. They drew the maps on <a href="http://fieldpapers.org/">Field Papers</a>, which were scanned, edited, and turned into geotiffs and markers. This is what they look like all together.</p>
	<p>Thanks to <a href="wassaicproject.org">The Wassaic Project</a>, Mr. Fitz at Webutuck High School, and <a href="http://stamen.com/">Stamen</a> for making Field Papers, seriously.</p>
